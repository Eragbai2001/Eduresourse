# 🚀 Search Algorithm - Quick Reference Card

## 📋 At a Glance

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Search Fields** | Title, Description, Department, Level |
| **Matching Type** | Partial (finds "java" in "javascript") |
| **Case Sensitive?** | No (JAVA = java = Java) |

| **Debounce Time** | 300ms |
| **Sort Order** | Downloads (DESC), then Date (DESC) |
| **Database Query** | Raw SQL with `LIKE` operator |

## 🎯 What Happens When You Search

```
1. Type "python" → Wait 300ms
2. Send query to /api/search
3. Database searches 4 fields
4. Returns top 10 matches
5. Display in dropdown
6. Click result → Go to course page
```

**Total Time: ~500ms** ⚡

## 💡 Search Tips for Users

✅ **DO:**
- Use simple keywords: "java", "beginner", "math"
- Try department names: "computer science"
- Search by difficulty: "advanced", "intermediate"

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use complex phrases with quotes
- Worry about capitalization
- Need exact spelling (partial match works!)

## 🔧 Technical Stack

```
Frontend: React + TypeScript
API: Next.js App Router
Database: PostgreSQL (Supabase)
ORM: Prisma (Raw SQL for performance)
Debouncing: Custom useEffect hook
```

2. **Single language** - No multi-language support yet
3. **Limited results** - Only 10 shown (by design)
4. **No advanced operators** - No AND/OR/NOT logic

## 🎓 For Developers

### To modify search fields:
1. Edit `/app/api/search/route.ts`
2. Add new field to SQL WHERE clause
3. Update SearchResource interface

### To change result limit:
```typescript
// In /app/api/search/route.ts
LIMIT 10  // Change this number
```

### To adjust debounce time:
```typescript
// In /app/components/SearchBar.tsx
setTimeout(() => { ... }, 300)  // Change 300ms
```

## 🎯 Key Takeaway

**The search algorithm is simple but effective:**
- Searches multiple fields at once
- Ranks by popularity
- Limits results for speed
- Debounces to reduce load
- Works on mobile and desktop

**Result: Fast, relevant search with minimal code!** 🚀
