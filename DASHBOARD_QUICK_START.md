## 🎯 How to Use It

### Option 1: Use the Ready-Made Component (Easiest)

```typescript
// In your app/dashboard/page.tsx
import DashboardStats from "../components/DashboardStats";

export default function DashboardPage() {
  return <DashboardStats />;
}
```

That's it! The component handles everything automatically.

### Option 2: Fetch Data Yourself

```typescript
"use client";

import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export default function CustomDashboard() {
  const [stats, setStats] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("/api/dashboard/stats")
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setStats(data.data));
  }, []);

  if (!stats) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Students: {stats.overview.totalStudents}</h1>
      <h1>Courses: {stats.overview.totalCourses}</h1>
      {/* Use the data as you need */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 🎨 Integrating with Your Designer's Dashboard

Your designer can use this data to populate their dashboard design:

### Map the Data:

**Overview Cards (Top Section)**
```typescript
stats.overview.totalStudents → "1,278" Total Students
stats.overview.totalCourses → "138" Total Courses  
stats.overview.totalEnrollments → "948" Total Enrollments
```

**Enrollment Trends Chart**
```typescript
stats.enrollmentTrends → { Jan: 450, Feb: 520, ... }
// Use with any chart library (Recharts, Chart.js, etc.)
```

**Top Courses Pie Chart**
```typescript
stats.topCourses → Array of courses with percentages
```

**Recent Activities**
```typescript
stats.recentResources → List of recently uploaded resources
```

## 💡 What's NOT Available (Because No Data Model)

❌ **Revenue** - You don't have payment/transaction tables
❌ **Detailed Learning Activity** - Would need more tracking (session time, clicks, etc.)

1. Payment/Revenue tracking models
2. User session tracking
3. Course progress tracking
4. Student performance metrics
